This Repo was forked from the famous openelec.tv done by sraue and others.
It's a base to bring the following improvements to my openelec setup:

- Owncloud Instance for my private cloud
- qemu-kvm support to get owncloud running in an secure enviorment and to split the service apart from the htpc
- Sickbeard with german language support

If you want something meaningfull and stable use the offical repo below, this one is dangerzone!
