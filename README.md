# OpenELEC - Open Embedded Linux Entertainment Center

OpenELEC runs [Kodi](http://kodi.tv), an award-winning free and open source (GPL) software media 
player and entertainment hub for digital media. For more info see http://kodi.tv .
The base system has been designed and built from the ground up to be as 
efficient as possible – consuming only tiny disk and memory footprints and
providing cutting edge hardware support to deliver a set-top box experience.

* Since OpenELEC includes code from many up stream projects it includes many

**Notes**

* SSH login details are user: “root” password: “openelec”.
  SSH allows command line access to your openelec.tv machine for configuration
  and file transfer. Linux/Mac clients can natively use SSH, while Windows
  users might want to try PuTTY for their terminal access.
* $HOME is mounted on /storage (the second ext4 partition on the drive). 
  All data transfered to the machine will go here, the rest of the system is
  read-only with the exception of /var (containing runtime configuration data).
* Manual update/downgrade procedure is as follows:
  Extract the snapshot and navigate to the 'target' directory.
  Copy KERNEL and SYSTEM along with KERNEL.md5 and SYSTEM.md5 to the 'Update' network share (or /storage/.update) on
  your openelec machine. Your system will automatically upgrade during the 
  next reboot.
* Automatic mounting of filesystems is supported. Devices such as USB Flash 
  sticks can be plugged into a running machine and will be mounted to /media,
  showing up in Kodi’s GUI.
* Comments and questions are more than welcome, help is even better and patches 
  are absolutely perfect!!
