# Lakka - The DIY retro emulation console

Lakka is a lightweight Linux distribution that transforms a credit card sized computer into a full blown emulation console.

## Features

* **Powerful** - Built on top of the famous RetroArch emulator, Lakka is able to emulate a large range of hardware and has some usefull features such as Braid-like rewinding, joypad hotplug and video streaming.
* **User friendly** - Lakka is easy to setup and use. Once installed to your SD card, you just have to put your rom on the card, plug your joypad and enjoy your favorite old games.
* **Low cost** - The hardware required to run Lakka cost only $35. We also support PS3 and XBox360 controllers so you don't have to buy new ones. The power can be supplied by any micro USB adapter like the one of your smartphone.
