tracker indefinitely. Sending a pull request is a much better way of getting a
particular feature into OpenELEC.

## Pull Requests

- **Add tests!** Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Create topic branches**. Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature**. If you want to do more than one thing, send
  multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history**. Make sure each individual commit in your pull
  request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while
  developing, please squash them before sending them to us.
