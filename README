The Open Embedded Linux Enterainment Center – OpenELEC.tv

OpenELEC.tv runs XBMC, a complete media center solution (xbmc.org).
The base system has been designed and built from the ground up to be as
efficient as possible – consuming only a tiny footprint, cutting edge
hardware support and a set-top box experience.

Source code:
- https://github.com/OpenELEC/OpenELEC.tv

Installation:
- Please read INSTALL for instructions how to install.

Known issues:
- Testing snapshot

Features:
- System size ~ 90MB
- Minimal hardware requirements
- Simple configuration

Software:
- xbmc HTPC software – View/Manage all your media.
- samba server – File transfer from any PC client
- Transmission – bittorrent client
- IR/Bluetooth Remote Control

Notes:
- Login details for SSH are user: “root” password: “openelec”
  SSH allows command line access to your openelec.tv machine for configuration
  and file transfer. Linux/mac clients can natively use SSH, windows users
  might want to try PuTTY for their terminal access.
- $HOME is mounted on /storage (the second ext4 partition on the drive). All
  data that you transfer to the machine will go here, the rest of the system is
  read-only with the exception of /var (which contains runtime configuration
  data).
- Manual update/downgrade procedure is as follows:
  Extract the snapshot and navigate to the 'target' directory
  Copy KERNEL and SYSTEM to the 'Update' network share (or /storage/.update) on
  your openelec machine.
  Your system will automatically upgrade during the next reboot.
- Automatic mounting of filesystems is supported. Devices such as USB Flash
  Sticks can be plugged into a running machine and will be mounted to /media,
  showing up in xbmc’s GUI.
- Comments and questions are more than welcome, help is even better and patches
  are absolutely perfect!!
