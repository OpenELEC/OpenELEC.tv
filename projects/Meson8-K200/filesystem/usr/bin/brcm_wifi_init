# Loading Broadcom SDIO driver on systems where the module is not present
# will cause problems with USB Wi-Fi. S802-based boxes has either Broadcom
# SDIO Wi-Fi module or Realtek 8188 module, so we load Broadcom driver
# only if Realtek 8188 module is not loaded, that should be done automatically,
# if it presents in the system

lsmod | grep 8188
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  modprobe dhd
