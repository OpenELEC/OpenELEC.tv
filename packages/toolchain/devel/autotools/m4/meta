PKG_LONGDESC="GNU 'M4' is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro processor. It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to macros). 'M4' also has built-in functions for including files, running shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc. Autoconf needs GNU 'M4' for generating 'configure' scripts, but not for running them."
