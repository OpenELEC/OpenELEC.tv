This driver contains a binary blob, is utterly broken,
breaks too much hardware that works without it,
and is there only to make self-builders happy.

You are free to use it but there will be no support at all.
Please dont ask us to include it in release builds by default.

To be absolutely clear there will be

=== NO SUPPORT ===

on this driver.
