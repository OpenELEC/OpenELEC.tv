PKG_LONGDESC="D-BUS is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications. Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in terms of complexity. D-BUS supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using XML. D-BUS also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple."
