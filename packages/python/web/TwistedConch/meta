PKG_LONGDESC="TwistedConch is an SSHv2 implementation written in Python. SSH is a protocol designed to allow remote access to shells and commands, but it is generic enough to allow everything from TCP forwarding to generic filesystem access. Since conch is written in Python, it interfaces well with other Python projects, such as Imagination. Conch also includes a implementations of the telnet and vt102 protocols, as well as support for rudimentary line editing behaviors. A new implementation of Twisted's Manhole application is also included, featuring server-side input history and interactive syntax coloring."
