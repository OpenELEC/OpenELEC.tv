PKG_SHORTDESC="sqlite: An Embeddable SQL Database Engine"
PKG_LONGDESC="SQLite is a C library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine. Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database access without running a separate RDBMS process. The distribution comes with a standalone command-line access program (sqlite) that can be used to administer an SQLite database and which serves as an example of how to use the SQLite library. SQLite is not a client library used to connect to a big database server. SQLite is the server. The SQLite library reads and writes directly to and from the database files on disk."

# This option adds additional logic to the ANALYZE command and to the query planner
# that can help SQLite to chose a better query plan under certain situations. The
# ANALYZE command is enhanced to collect histogram data from each index and store
# that data in the sqlite_stat3 table. The query planner will then use the histogram
# data to help it make better index choices.
  CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DSQLITE_ENABLE_STAT3"

# When this C-preprocessor macro is defined, SQLite includes some additional APIs
# that provide convenient access to meta-data about tables and queries. The APIs that
# are enabled by this option are:
#  - sqlite3_column_database_name()
#  - sqlite3_column_database_name16()
#  - sqlite3_column_table_name()
#  - sqlite3_column_table_name16()
#  - sqlite3_column_origin_name()
#  - sqlite3_column_origin_name16()
#  - sqlite3_table_column_metadata()
  CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DSQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA=1"

# This macro sets the default limit on the amount of memory that will be used for
# memory-mapped I/O for each open database file. If the N is zero, then memory
# mapped I/O is disabled by default. This compile-time limit and the
# SQLITE_MAX_MMAP_SIZE can be modified at start-time using the
# sqlite3_config(SQLITE_CONFIG_MMAP_SIZE) call, or at run-time using the
# mmap_size pragma.
