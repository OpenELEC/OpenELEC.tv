# This option adds additional logic to the ANALYZE command and to the query planner 
# that can help SQLite to chose a better query plan under certain situations. The
# ANALYZE command is enhanced to collect histogram data from each index and store
# that data in the sqlite_stat3 table. The query planner will then use the histogram
# data to help it make better index choices.
