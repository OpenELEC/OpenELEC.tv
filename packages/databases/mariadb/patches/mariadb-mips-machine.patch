Description: Fix DEFAULT_MACHINE on mips
 The DEFAULT_MACHINE constant is calculated from the CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
 variable which contains the processor which built mariadb. Since most Debian
 buildds run on 64-bit hardware even though they build 32-bit binaries,
 DEFAULT_MACHINE previously contained "mips64" on 32-bit builds. This confuses
 some mroonga tests which rely on DEFAULT_MACHINE to detect 64-bitness.
 .
 This patch fixes the value of DEFAULT_MACHINE so it always contains just "mips"
 on 32-bit mips builds.
