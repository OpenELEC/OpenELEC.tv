# netmount.conf
#
# This configuration file allows you to setup network mounts via
# CIFS (Samba), NFS or AFP while the system is booting
#
# This is an sample file, please rename or copy this file to
# netmount.conf in the samba share "Configfiles" (or /storage/.config/)
#
# Usage:
# service | share on server | local mountpoint <| mount options>
#
# - "service" can be "nfs" for NFS mounts, "cifs" for CIFS (Samba) or
#   "afp" for AFP (Apple File Protocol) mounts
# - Please use an "|" as delimiter
# - Don't use spaces in usernames, passwords and options
# - be aware of the different syntax for NFS and AFP mounts
# - Local mountpoints should only be on /storage
#
# Examples:
# AFP (Apple File Protocol) mounts, please specify username and password if
# needed.
# afp | 192.168.1.44/videos | /storage/mount/videos | <username>:<password>

# CIFS (Samba/ Windows share) mounts, please specify username and password if
# needed (comma seperated).
# cifs | //192.168.1.44/videos | /storage/mount/videos | username=user,pass=secret
# cifs | //192.168.1.44/tv shows | /storage/mount/tvshows | username=user,pass=secret

# NFS (Network File System) mounts, please specify additional options if needed
# (comma seperated). Default options are 'tcp' and 'nolock'.
