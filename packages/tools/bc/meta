PKG_SHORTDESC="bc: GNU's numeric processing language and a calculator"
PKG_LONGDESC="Bc is an arbitrary precision numeric processing language. Syntax is similar to C, but differs in many substantial areas. It supports interactive execution of statements. Bc is a utility included in the POSIX P1003.2/D11 draft standard. Since the POSIX document does not specify how bc must be implemented, this version does not use the historical method of having bc be a compiler for the dc calculator. This version has a single executable that both compiles the language and runs the resulting 'byte code'. The byte code is not the dc language."
