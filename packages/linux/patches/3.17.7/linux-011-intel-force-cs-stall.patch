Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Force the CS stall for invalidate flushes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In order to act as a full command barrier by itself, we need to tell the
pipecontrol to actually stall the command streamer while the flush runs.
We require the full command barrier before operations like
MI_SET_CONTEXT, which currently rely on a prior invalidate flush.
