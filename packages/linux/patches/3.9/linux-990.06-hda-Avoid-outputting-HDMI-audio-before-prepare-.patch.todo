Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda - Avoid outputting HDMI audio before prepare() and
 after close()

Some HDMI codecs (at least NVIDIA 0x10de000b:0x10de0101:0x100100) start
transmitting an empty audio stream as soon as PIN_OUT and AC_DIG1_ENABLE
are enabled.

Since commit 6169b673618bf0b2518ce413b54925782a603f06 ("ALSA: hda -
Always turn on pins for HDMI/DP") this happens at first open() time, and
will continue even after close().

Additionally, some codecs (at least Intel PantherPoint HDMI) currently
continue transmitting HDMI audio even after close() in case some actual
audio was output after open() (this happens regardless of PIN_OUT).

Empty HDMI audio transmission when not intended has the effect that a
possible HDMI audio sink/receiver may prefer the empty HDMI audio stream
over an actual audio stream on its S/PDIF inputs.

To avoid the issue before first prepare(), set stream format to 0 on
codec initialization. 0 is not a valid format value for HDMI and will
prevent the audio stream from being output.

Additionally, at close() time, make sure that the stream is cleaned up.
This will ensure that the format is reset to 0 at that time, preventing
audio from being output in that case.

Thanks to OpenELEC developers and users for their help in investigating
this issue on the affected NVIDIA "ION2" hardware. Testing of the final
version on NVIDIA ION2 was done by OpenELEC user "MrXIII". Testing on
Intel PantherPoint was done by myself.
