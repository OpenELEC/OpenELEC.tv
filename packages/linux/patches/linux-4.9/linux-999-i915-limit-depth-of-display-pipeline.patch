Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Limit the depth of the display pipeline to the
 framebuffer

There is little point in using higher bitdepth inside the pipeline if
the endpoints are of lower accuracy. Using the higher bitdepth requires
extra bandwidth, often to the point of failure - such as signal loss and
blank displays.

Since commit 7a0baa623446 ("Revert "drm/i915: Disable 12bpc hdmi for
now"") we have had users reporting blank screens and rightfully
complaining about the regressions. Whilst these are using due to some
other underlying bug, they have lingered and still remain unresolved. So
let's try a different tact and avoid using higher bitdepths than
required.
