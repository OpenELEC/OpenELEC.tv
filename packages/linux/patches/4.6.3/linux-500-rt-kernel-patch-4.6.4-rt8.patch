+Introduction:
+-------------
+
+The module hwlat_detector is a special purpose kernel module that is used to
+detect large system latencies induced by the behavior of certain underlying
+hardware or firmware, independent of Linux itself. The code was developed
+originally to detect SMIs (System Management Interrupts) on x86 systems,
+however there is nothing x86 specific about this patchset. It was
+originally written for use by the "RT" patch since the Real Time
+kernel is highly latency sensitive.
+
+SMIs are usually not serviced by the Linux kernel, which typically does not
+even know that they are occuring. SMIs are instead are set up by BIOS code
+and are serviced by BIOS code, usually for "critical" events such as
+management of thermal sensors and fans. Sometimes though, SMIs are used for
+other tasks and those tasks can spend an inordinate amount of time in the
+handler (sometimes measured in milliseconds). Obviously this is a problem if
+you are trying to keep event service latencies down in the microsecond range.
+
+The hardware latency detector works by hogging all of the cpus for configurable
+amounts of time (by calling stop_machine()), polling the CPU Time Stamp Counter
+for some period, then looking for gaps in the TSC data. Any gap indicates a
+time when the polling was interrupted and since the machine is stopped and
+interrupts turned off the only thing that could do that would be an SMI.
+
+Note that the SMI detector should *NEVER* be used in a production environment.
+It is intended to be run manually to determine if the hardware platform has a
+problem with long system firmware service routines.
+
+Usage:
+------
+
+Loading the module hwlat_detector passing the parameter "enabled=1" (or by
+setting the "enable" entry in "hwlat_detector" debugfs toggled on) is the only
+step required to start the hwlat_detector. It is possible to redefine the
+threshold in microseconds (us) above which latency spikes will be taken
+into account (parameter "threshold=").
+
+Example:
+
+	# modprobe hwlat_detector enabled=1 threshold=100
+
+After the module is loaded, it creates a directory named "hwlat_detector" under
+the debugfs mountpoint, "/debug/hwlat_detector" for this text. It is necessary
+to have debugfs mounted, which might be on /sys/debug on your system.
+
+The /debug/hwlat_detector interface contains the following files:
+
+count			- number of latency spikes observed since last reset
+enable			- a global enable/disable toggle (0/1), resets count
+max			- maximum hardware latency actually observed (usecs)
+sample			- a pipe from which to read current raw sample data
+			  in the format <timestamp> <latency observed usecs>
+			  (can be opened O_NONBLOCK for a single sample)
+threshold		- minimum latency value to be considered (usecs)
+width			- time period to sample with CPUs held (usecs)
+			  must be less than the total window size (enforced)
+window			- total period of sampling, width being inside (usecs)
+
+By default we will set width to 500,000 and window to 1,000,000, meaning that
+we will sample every 1,000,000 usecs (1s) for 500,000 usecs (0.5s). If we
+observe any latencies that exceed the threshold (initially 100 usecs),
+then we write to a global sample ring buffer of 8K samples, which is
+consumed by reading from the "sample" (pipe) debugfs file interface.

+		Using the Linux Kernel Latency Histograms
+
+
+This document gives a short explanation how to enable, configure and use
+latency histograms. Latency histograms are primarily relevant in the
+context of real-time enabled kernels (CONFIG_PREEMPT/CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT)
+and are used in the quality management of the Linux real-time
+capabilities.
+
+
+* Purpose of latency histograms
+
+A latency histogram continuously accumulates the frequencies of latency
+data. There are two types of histograms
+- potential sources of latencies
+- effective latencies
+
+
+* Potential sources of latencies
+
+Potential sources of latencies are code segments where interrupts,
+preemption or both are disabled (aka critical sections). To create
+histograms of potential sources of latency, the kernel stores the time
+stamp at the start of a critical section, determines the time elapsed
+when the end of the section is reached, and increments the frequency
+counter of that latency value - irrespective of whether any concurrently
+running process is affected by latency or not.
+- Configuration items (in the Kernel hacking/Tracers submenu)
+  CONFIG_INTERRUPT_OFF_LATENCY
+  CONFIG_PREEMPT_OFF_LATENCY
+
+
+* Effective latencies
+
+Effective latencies are actually occuring during wakeup of a process. To
+determine effective latencies, the kernel stores the time stamp when a
+process is scheduled to be woken up, and determines the duration of the
+wakeup time shortly before control is passed over to this process. Note
+that the apparent latency in user space may be somewhat longer, since the
+process may be interrupted after control is passed over to it but before
+the execution in user space takes place. Simply measuring the interval
+between enqueuing and wakeup may also not appropriate in cases when a
+process is scheduled as a result of a timer expiration. The timer may have
+missed its deadline, e.g. due to disabled interrupts, but this latency
+would not be registered. Therefore, the offsets of missed timers are
+recorded in a separate histogram. If both wakeup latency and missed timer
+offsets are configured and enabled, a third histogram may be enabled that
+records the overall latency as a sum of the timer latency, if any, and the
+wakeup latency. This histogram is called "timerandwakeup".
+- Configuration items (in the Kernel hacking/Tracers submenu)
+  CONFIG_WAKEUP_LATENCY
+  CONFIG_MISSED_TIMER_OFSETS
+
+
+* Usage
+
+The interface to the administration of the latency histograms is located
+in the debugfs file system. To mount it, either enter
+
+mount -t sysfs nodev /sys
+mount -t debugfs nodev /sys/kernel/debug
+
+from shell command line level, or add
+
+nodev	/sys			sysfs	defaults	0 0
+nodev	/sys/kernel/debug	debugfs	defaults	0 0
+
+to the file /etc/fstab. All latency histogram related files are then
+available in the directory /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/latency_hist. A
+particular histogram type is enabled by writing non-zero to the related
+variable in the /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/latency_hist/enable directory.
+Select "preemptirqsoff" for the histograms of potential sources of
+latencies and "wakeup" for histograms of effective latencies etc. The
+histogram data - one per CPU - are available in the files
+
+/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/latency_hist/preemptoff/CPUx
+/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/latency_hist/irqsoff/CPUx
+/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/latency_hist/preemptirqsoff/CPUx
+/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/latency_hist/wakeup/CPUx
+/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/latency_hist/wakeup/sharedprio/CPUx
+/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/latency_hist/missed_timer_offsets/CPUx
+/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/latency_hist/timerandwakeup/CPUx
+
+The histograms are reset by writing non-zero to the file "reset" in a
+particular latency directory. To reset all latency data, use
+
+#!/bin/sh
+
+TRACINGDIR=/sys/kernel/debug/tracing
+HISTDIR=$TRACINGDIR/latency_hist
+
+if test -d $HISTDIR
+then
+  cd $HISTDIR
+  for i in `find . | grep /reset$`
+  do
+    echo 1 >$i
+  done
+fi
+
+
+* Data format
+
+Latency data are stored with a resolution of one microsecond. The
+maximum latency is 10,240 microseconds. The data are only valid, if the
+overflow register is empty. Every output line contains the latency in
+microseconds in the first row and the number of samples in the second
+row. To display only lines with a positive latency count, use, for
+example,
+
+grep -v " 0$" /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/latency_hist/preemptoff/CPU0
+
+#Minimum latency: 0 microseconds.
+#Average latency: 0 microseconds.
+#Maximum latency: 25 microseconds.
+#Total samples: 3104770694
+#There are 0 samples greater or equal than 10240 microseconds
+#usecs	         samples
+    0	      2984486876
+    1	        49843506

+   14	            5602

+   25	               1
+
+
+* Wakeup latency of a selected process
+
+To only collect wakeup latency data of a particular process, write the
+PID of the requested process to
+
+/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/latency_hist/wakeup/pid
+
+PIDs are not considered, if this variable is set to 0.
+
+
+* Details of the process with the highest wakeup latency so far
+
+Selected data of the process that suffered from the highest wakeup
+latency that occurred in a particular CPU are available in the file
+
+/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/latency_hist/wakeup/max_latency-CPUx.
+
+In addition, other relevant system data at the time when the
+latency occurred are given.
+
+The format of the data is (all in one line):
+<PID> <Priority> <Latency> (<Timeroffset>) <Command> \
+<- <PID> <Priority> <Command> <Timestamp>
+
+The value of <Timeroffset> is only relevant in the combined timer
+and wakeup latency recording. In the wakeup recording, it is
+always 0, in the missed_timer_offsets recording, it is the same
+as <Latency>.
+
+When retrospectively searching for the origin of a latency and
+tracing was not enabled, it may be helpful to know the name and
+some basic data of the task that (finally) was switching to the
+late real-tlme task. In addition to the victim's data, also the
+data of the possible culprit are therefore displayed after the
+"<-" symbol.
+
+Finally, the timestamp of the time when the latency occurred
+in <seconds>.<microseconds> after the most recent system boot
+is provided.
+
+These data are also reset when the wakeup histogram is reset.

+ * hwlat_detector.c - A simple Hardware Latency detector.
+ *
+ * Use this module to detect large system latencies induced by the behavior of
+ * certain underlying system hardware or firmware, independent of Linux itself.
+ * The code was developed originally to detect the presence of SMIs on Intel
+ * and AMD systems, although there is no dependency upon x86 herein.
+ *
+ * The classical example usage of this module is in detecting the presence of
+ * SMIs or System Management Interrupts on Intel and AMD systems. An SMI is a
+ * somewhat special form of hardware interrupt spawned from earlier CPU debug
+ * modes in which the (BIOS/EFI/etc.) firmware arranges for the South Bridge
+ * LPC (or other device) to generate a special interrupt under certain
+ * circumstances, for example, upon expiration of a special SMI timer device,
+ * due to certain external thermal readings, on certain I/O address accesses,
+ * and other situations. An SMI hits a special CPU pin, triggers a special
+ * SMI mode (complete with special memory map), and the OS is unaware.
+ *
+ * Although certain hardware-inducing latencies are necessary (for example,
+ * a modern system often requires an SMI handler for correct thermal control
+ * and remote management) they can wreak havoc upon any OS-level performance
+ * guarantees toward low-latency, especially when the OS is not even made
+ * aware of the presence of these interrupts. For this reason, we need a
+ * somewhat brute force mechanism to detect these interrupts. In this case,
+ * we do it by hogging all of the CPU(s) for configurable timer intervals,
+ * sampling the built-in CPU timer, looking for discontiguous readings.
+ *
+ * WARNING: This implementation necessarily introduces latencies. Therefore,
+ *          you should NEVER use this module in a production environment
+ *          requiring any kind of low-latency performance guarantee(s).

+ * historic credit for proving that Linux spinlocks can be implemented via
+ * RT-aware mutexes goes to many people: The Pmutex project (Dirk Grambow
+ * and others) who prototyped it on 2.4 and did lots of comparative
+ * research and analysis; TimeSys, for proving that you can implement a
+ * fully preemptible kernel via the use of IRQ threading and mutexes;
+ * Bill Huey for persuasively arguing on lkml that the mutex model is the
+ * right one; and to MontaVista, who ported pmutexes to 2.6.
+ *
+ * This code is a from-scratch implementation and is not based on pmutexes,
+ * but the idea of converting spinlocks to mutexes is used here too.

 /*
- * per-CPU timer vector definitions:
+ * The timer wheel has LVL_DEPTH array levels. Each level provides an array of
+ * LVL_SIZE buckets. Each level is driven by its own clock and therefor each
+ * level has a different granularity.
+ *
+ * The level granularity is:		LVL_CLK_DIV ^ lvl
+ * The level clock frequency is:	HZ / (LVL_CLK_DIV ^ level)
+ *
+ * The array level of a newly armed timer depends on the relative expiry
+ * time. The farther the expiry time is away the higher the array level and
+ * therefor the granularity becomes.
+ *
+ * Contrary to the original timer wheel implementation, which aims for 'exact'
+ * expiry of the timers, this implementation removes the need for recascading
+ * the timers into the lower array levels. The previous 'classic' timer wheel
+ * implementation of the kernel already violated the 'exact' expiry by adding
+ * slack to the expiry time to provide batched expiration. The granularity
+ * levels provide implicit batching.
+ *
+ * This is an optimization of the original timer wheel implementation for the
+ * majority of the timer wheel use cases: timeouts. The vast majority of
+ * timeout timers (networking, disk I/O ...) are canceled before expiry. If
+ * the timeout expires it indicates that normal operation is disturbed, so it
+ * does not matter much whether the timeout comes with a slight delay.
+ *
+ * The only exception to this are networking timers with a small expiry
+ * time. They rely on the granularity. Those fit into the first wheel level,
+ * which has HZ granularity.
+ *
+ * We don't have cascading anymore. timers with a expiry time above the
+ * capacity of the last wheel level are force expired at the maximum timeout
+ * value of the last wheel level. From data sampling we know that the maximum
+ * value observed is 5 days (network connection tracking), so this should not
+ * be an issue.
+ *
+ * The currently chosen array constants values are a good compromise between
+ * array size and granularity.
+ *
+ * This results in the following granularity and range levels:
+ *
+ * HZ 1000 steps
+ * Level Offset  Granularity            Range
