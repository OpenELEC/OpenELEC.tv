PKG_LONGDESC="Unrar is a package to handle files compressed in the RAR format. Due to strange licensing issues this package can only view, test and extract files in a given archive, but not pack files. But since we have far more advanced open-source compression utils it should be enough to extract the content when you get a RAR archive."
