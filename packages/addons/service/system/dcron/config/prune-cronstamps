# /etc/cron.d/prune-cronstamps

# Prunes any files in /var/spool/cron/cronstamps that haven't been used in ninety
# days. We check that both mtime and atime are greater than this:
#
#   atime because the cronstamp may be in use (crond is reading it) but the
# job keeps failing. So the cronstamp hasn't yet been updated.
#
# mtime because the volume the cronstamp is located on may be mounted noatime
# and so its atime won't be updated. At least its mtime will be updated when
# it's modified.
